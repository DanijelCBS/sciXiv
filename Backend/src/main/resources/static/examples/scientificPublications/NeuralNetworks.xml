            We believe that the problem to progress in OMR for CWMN lies in the complexity involved in
            correctly modeling the composition of musical symbols. Unlike these hand-engineered multi-stage
            approaches, we propose a holistic strategy in which the musical notation is learned as a whole using
            machine learning strategies. However, to reduce the complexity to a feasible level, we do consider
            a first initial stage in which the image is pre-processed to find and separate the different staves of the
            score. Staves are good basic units to work on, analogously to similar text recognition where a single
            line of text is assumed as input unit. Note that this is not a strong assumption as there are successful
            algorithms for isolating staves, as mentioned above.

            Despite the great advantages of its development, OMR is far from being totally reliable as
            a black box, as current optical character <sp:referencePointer refId="1">recognition</sp:referencePointer> or speech recognition technologies do.
            Commercial software is constantly being improved by fixing specific problems from version to
            version. In the scientific community, there are hardly any complete approach for its <sp:referencePointer refId="1">solution</sp:referencePointer><sp:referencePointer refId="2"></sp:referencePointer>.
            Traditionally, this has been motivated because of the small sub-tasks in which the workflow can be
            divided. Simpler tasks such as <sp:referencePointer refId="2">staff-line removal,</sp:referencePointer> symbol localization and classification, or music
            notation assembly, have so far represented major obstacles.

            We believe that the problem to progress in OMR for CWMN lies in the complexity involved in
            correctly modeling the composition of musical symbols. Unlike these hand-engineered multi-stage
            approaches, we propose a holistic strategy in which the musical notation is learned as a whole using
            machine learning strategies. However, to reduce the complexity to a feasible level, we do consider
            a first initial stage in which the image is pre-processed to find and separate the different staves of the
            score. Staves are good basic units to work on, analogously to similar text recognition where a single
            line of text is assumed as input unit. Note that this is not a strong assumption as there are successful
            algorithms for isolating staves, as mentioned above.
            Then, the staff can be addressed as a single unit instead of considering it as a sequence of isolated
            elements that have to be detected and recognized independently. This also opens the possibility
            to boost the optical recognition by taking into account the musical context which, in spite of being
            extremely difficult to model entirely, can certainly help in the process. Thus, it seems interesting to
            tackle the OMR task over single staves in an holistic fashion, in which the expected output is directly
            the sequence of musical symbols present in the image.

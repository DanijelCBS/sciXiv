            <emphasizedText>We believe that the problem to progress in OMR for CWMN lies in the complexity involved in
                correctly modeling the composition of musical symbols. Unlike these hand-engineered multi-stage
                approaches, we propose a holistic strategy in which the musical notation is learned as a whole using
                machine learning strategies. However, to reduce the complexity to a feasible level, we do consider
                a first initial stage in which the image is pre-processed to find and separate the different staves of the
                score. Staves are good basic units to work on, analogously to similar text recognition where a single
                line of text is assumed as input unit. Note that this is not a strong assumption as there are successful
                algorithms for isolating staves, as mentioned above.

                Then, the staff can be addressed as a single unit instead of considering it as a sequence of isolated
                elements that have to be detected and recognized independently. This also opens the possibility
                to boost the optical recognition by taking into account the musical context which, in spite of being
                extremely difficult to model entirely, can certainly help in the process. Thus, it seems interesting to
                tackle the OMR task over single staves in an holistic fashion, in which the expected output is directly
                the sequence of musical symbols present in the image.</emphasizedText>

            <emphasizedText>MusicXML was invented by Michael Good and initially developed by Recordare LLC. It derived several key concepts from existing academic formats 
                (such as Walter Hewlett's MuseData and David Huron's Humdrum). It is designed for the interchange of scores, particularly between different scorewriters. 
                MusicXML development was managed by MakeMusic following the company's acquisition of Recordare in 2011.[6][7] MusicXML development was transferred to the 
                W3C Music Notation Community Group in July 2015.[8] 
                Version 1.0 was released in January 2004. Version 1.1 was released in May 2005 with improved formatting support. Version 2.0 was released in June 2007 
                and included a standard compressed format.[9] All of these versions were defined by a series of document type definitions (DTDs). An XML Schema Definition 
                (XSD) implementation of Version 2.0 was released in September 2008. Version 3.0 was released in August 2011 with improved virtual instrument support, in 
                both DTD and XSD versions.[10][11] Version 3.1 was released in December 2017 with improved support for the Standard Music Font Layout (SMuFL).[3] The MusicXML
                DTDs and XSDs are each freely redistributable under the W3C Community Final Specification Agreement.[5]</emphasizedText>

            <boldText>Example</boldText>
            <emphasizedText>Like all XML-based formats, MusicXML is intended to be easy for automated tools to parse and manipulate. Though it is possible to create MusicXML
                by hand, interactive score writing programs like Finale and MuseScore greatly simplify the reading, writing, and modifying of MusicXML files. 
                The following example is a score consisting of a single whole note middle C in the key of C major on the Treble Clef.[16]</emphasizedText>

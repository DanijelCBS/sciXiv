            <emphasizedText>We believe that the problem to progress in OMR for CWMN lies in the complexity involved in
                correctly modeling the composition of musical symbols. Unlike these hand-engineered multi-stage
                approaches, we propose a holistic strategy in which the musical notation is learned as a whole using
                machine learning strategies. However, to reduce the complexity to a feasible level, we do consider
                a first initial stage in which the image is pre-processed to find and separate the different staves of the
                score. Staves are good basic units to work on, analogously to similar text recognition where a single
                line of text is assumed as input unit. Note that this is not a strong assumption as there are successful
                algorithms for isolating staves, as mentioned above.

            <boldText>SMDL</boldText>
            <emphasizedText>Several attempts to address this unfortunate situation have beenmade, chief among which are the Notation Interchange File Format (NIFF)and the 
                Standard Music Description Language (SMDL). NIFF was completedin 1995 and was designed specifically as a music-notation interchangestandard. Even though it
                has been adopted by several notation andmusic-scanning programs, its graphical approach to representing musicinformation limits its usefulness for performance 
                applications. WhileSMDL has reached the status of official standard (ISO/IEC DraftInternational Standard 10743), it suffers from the opposite extreme oftrying
                to be all things to all people.</emphasizedText>

            <boldText>MARKUP FOR MUSIC</boldText>
            <emphasizedText>This problem is not unique to music applications. Demand forinteroperability among products from competing vendors has been thebane of the computer 
                industry since its birth. Fortunately, a solutionhas arisen from the world of Internet applications: the ExtensibleMarkup Language (XML). XML has emerged as 
                the accepted standard fordata representation and interchange among commercial software packages.Readers of EM are probably familiar with XML as it relates 
                toWeb pages (see “Mark My Words” in the November 2001 issue).But readers may not realize that XML has capabilities that reach farbeyond just souping up home
                pages.
                XML is a markup language for defining markup languages. It allowsyou to define a grammar for describing the data associated with anygroup or class of
                computer applications. When two programs want toshare data, they exchange a highly structured text document thatconforms to the syntax rules of XML and 
                the grammatical rules that thetwo programs have agreed upon.
                XML requires you to define your grammar in the form of another XMLdocument called a schema or a Document Type Definition (DTD). Byfollowing XML's rules 
                for creating a valid DTD, you don't need to worryabout how your grammar will be interpreted by a program. There arestandard tools for that, and that frees 
                you to focus on how to organizeand represent the data you want to share. This balance of flexibilityand consistency is the core strength of XML as a vehicle
                for datainterchange.</emphasizedText>

            <boldText>Example</boldText>
            <emphasizedText>Like all XML-based formats, MusicXML is intended to be easy for automated tools to parse and manipulate. Though it is possible to create MusicXML
                by hand, interactive score writing programs like Finale and MuseScore greatly simplify the reading, writing, and modifying of MusicXML files. 
                The following example is a score consisting of a single whole note middle C in the key of C major on the Treble Clef.[16]</emphasizedText>
